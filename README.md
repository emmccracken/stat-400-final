STAT 400 Data Mining and Machine Learning fall 2023  
Final Project Description  

Project requirements:  

Groups: I would like you to work in groups of size 2 or 3 (4 is possible with special permission)
on the project.   

Project proposal:  
Each team will be required to submit a project proposal by Monday, November 13 before class.
The proposal should include the topic and dataset that the group would like to use and the
reason(s) that the group chose that topic and dataset. The proposal must also include a first
description of the data items that you will do preliminary data exploration on. In addition, the
proposal must include a set of at least four proposed goals for the data mining effort. The project
proposal should also include a description of the data mining and machine learning techniques
and processes that the group intends to employ. I will review the proposals with each team and
recommend modifications to the plan, if I have any, and will approve the proposals before work
will commence on the main project itself.  

Presentation:  
Each team will make a short 10 to 15 minute presentation to the class on the work done on the
project.   

Final paper:   
Each group will submit a final paper describing all the work completed, the analysis done, and
conclusions reached in the process. The paper should include output generated from software for
the project work.  

The deadline for submitting the final version of the paper will be the last day of class or on our
final exam day (there is no final exam)
